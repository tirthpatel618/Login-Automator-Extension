Safari web extension (Not yet on the extension store) 

This Login Automator Extension is made to replicate what apple products do when you recieve a text message for 2 factor authentication, but for emails. 

When you encounter a page that sends a code to your email for 2 factor authentication, you can activate the extension and you will recieve that code in your browser, making it easy for you to fill out the code
